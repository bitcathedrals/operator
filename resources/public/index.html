      <p>
        Operator is nothing short of a paradigm shift in web
        services. It is as revolutionary as the search engine was to the
        web. I have dubbed it WYSWIG 2.0 or a smart service for smart
        phones.
      </p>

      <p>
        WYSWIG ? (W)hat (Y)ou (S)ay is (W)what you (G)et. All current
        generation web services except search engines are fundamentally
        *traversed* as networks of hyperlinks. Operator in contrast
        interprets what the user *says* to the web service and
        dynamically generates content specific to the user's query.
      </p>

      <p>
        This query &amp; response model means that the user can talk/text
        directly to the webservice and receive the results of their
        queries/commands on their phone's browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        Contrast these two models:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>navigating <span>[home -> login -> accounts -> select history,select 10 transactions -> results]</span></li>
        <li>
          The user says "the last ten transactions on my account" and
          receives a page that is the last ten transactions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This idea leverages three key technologies: the modern smartphone with a browser,
        the twilio service, and the SMS messsage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The user either calls or text's a twilio number. The new paradigm web service sends
        back a SMS message with a hyperlink to the generated response to their query. They
        say what they want the webservice to do, and they get a truly dynamic web page back
        in a hyperlink they tap on.

      <h1><a name="diff">How Operator differs from existing web services paradigms</a></h1>

      <p>
        Some differences between the operator concept and existing web-services:
      </p>

      <p>
        Operator is a leap beyond the search box on a website. A search
        box simply searches the network of hyperlinks that *can be
        crawled*. This is why they suck so bad. Because the content
        returned is not a answer to what they asked, it is a list of
        nodes in the network crawled by the search engine that seem to
        match some keywords.
      </p>

      <p>
        Operator is the future of web-services for Smart Phones. The
        screen on a smart-phone is to small to manage or traverse a
        classic "network of hyperlinks" model interface. Also the input
        bandwith of a tiny or touch keyboard, or the user's time to talk
        into a phone number is simply to small.
      </p>

      <p>
        Do you hate "press 1 for x ... press 2 for y, press 3 to return
        to the previous menu ... ? This is what happens when you use a
        tree/network paradigm on a voice interface.
      </p>

      <p>
        What operator is looking to do for web-services is what google did to
        phones: being able to speak a command/query into the web-service, and
        get back a screen full of what you *wanted*. Like saying "pizza hut" into
        google, and getting back the nearest pizza hut with a phone number you
        can tap to phone.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h1><a name="readyforzero">So What does this mean for ReadyForZero ?</a></h1>

      <p>
        Not only is the operator concept a unique (AFAIK) interface it is a paradigm
        shift. Paradigm shifts generate buzz. Imagine demo'ing to the NY Times tuesday
        tech team. That attention only comes from red-hot tech. Operator is hot *now*.
      </p>

      <p>
        Operator is the future of web-services. Be the first on the block to do it
        google style.
      </p>

      <p>
        Who else does this ? Nobody ... I am serious. Only search engines really work
        this way. Everyone else is still using a "network of hyperlinks" as their
        web service UI model. Phone interfaces still use tree structured menus.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h1><a name="works">How does it work ?</a></h1>

      <ol>
        <li>The user talks or texts a query to the web-serice phone number.</li>
        <li>Twilio translates/delivers the message via a POST to the web-server.</li>
        <li>The web server analyzes the query. From the analysis a URI is generated.</li>
        <li>
          The response back to twilio in TwilML causes a text message to
          be sent with the hyperlink to the URL of the dynamic
          content
        </li>
        <li>
          When the user taps on the hyperlink the smart-phone opens a browser window to
          the URL. bam ... results in mere seconds. Exactly what they asked for.
        </li>
      </ol>
